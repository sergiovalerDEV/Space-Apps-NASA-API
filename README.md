# Global Eco-Events Tracker

## 🌟 Overview
Global Eco-Events Tracker is an interactive web application that visualizes real-time meteorological and environmental events worldwide. By leveraging NASA's EONET API and MapTiler's powerful mapping capabilities, this project aims to raise awareness about our planet's dynamic ecosystems and the importance of environmental conservation.

## 🌍 Features
- Real-time tracking of global environmental events
- Interactive world map powered by MapTiler
- Date-based filtering of events
- Categorized event icons for easy identification
- Detailed pop-up information for each event
- Responsive and clean user interface

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+)
- NASA EONET API
- MapTiler SDK
- Fetch API for asynchronous requests

## 🚀 Getting Started
1. Clone the repository
2. Open `index.html` in your browser
3. Ensure you have an active internet connection for API calls

## 🔧 Configuration
- Obtain a MapTiler API key and replace it in the code
- Customize category icons in the `categoryImages` object

## 💻 Code Highlights
- **Map Initialization**: Utilizes MapTiler SDK to create an interactive world map
- **Event Fetching**: Asynchronously retrieves event data from NASA's EONET API
- **Custom Markers**: Creates category-specific markers for each event
- **Date Filtering**: Allows users to filter events based on a specified date range
- **Popup Information**: Displays detailed event information in interactive popups

## 🌿 Environmental Awareness
This project serves as a powerful tool for visualizing the impact of various environmental phenomena on our planet. By providing real-time data on events such as wildfires, floods, and storms, we aim to:

- Increase awareness of global environmental challenges
- Encourage proactive measures in environmental conservation
- Support educational initiatives on climate change and natural disasters
- Inspire users to take action in protecting our planet's ecosystems

## 🧹 Clean Code Practices
- Modular function design for improved readability and maintenance
- Clear and descriptive variable and function names
- Consistent code formatting and indentation
- Comprehensive error handling and logging
- Efficient use of asynchronous programming techniques

## 🔜 Future Enhancements
- Implement more advanced filtering options (e.g., by event type, severity)
- Add historical data analysis and trend visualization
- Integrate with additional environmental APIs for more comprehensive data
- Develop a mobile app version for on-the-go access
